### EU Bylaws

The EU Bylaws are outdated and not maintained, and should be completely re-written if the move to the Netherlands is approved. We no longer have a copy of the the originals of either bylaws. If anyone can assist with this, please let us know.

### REPORTS

### Executive Director Report

There was no business conducted by the EU entity in the last year, other than as a VAT vehicle. The movement to the Netherlands is still in progress, and likely will require a visit to Amsterdam to complete an interview. This could have been held remotely during COVID, but it is my understanding that this will be in person now. Once my immigration is sorted, I will be able to complete this task.

#### Director compliance requirement

The SR FIDUCIAIRE CVBA firm has asked the following of the eventual EU Board members: "When you mail us the minutes, can you also mail us the passports of all the members of the board of directors?"

### Finance Report

To be presented by Shelby Graham. Please ask any questions, including around the unauthorized bank account opened by a previous director, and the progress on migrating EU finances to be more manageable and for far lower cost.
